Agentic Coding Durability Evaluation Set
========================

This repository collects real-world coding tasks across multiple languages and tech stacks, with varying difficulty. It helps developers evaluate how durable different agentic coding products are when tackling diverse, practical programming work.

## How to Use

1. Choose a repository for the language/stack you care about.
2. Open the project folder and read `Prompt.md` or `Prompt.zh.md`.
3. Run the prompt in your chosen AI coding product (e.g., Qoder, Cursor, Windsurf, Kiro, Claude Code).
4. Iterate until you personally judge the task “done.”
   - This evaluation set intentionally does not include automated unit/integration/UI tests to decide completion.
   - We rely on your human judgment, similar to real-world work where completeness, test coverage, visual acceptance, and maintainability vary by person.
5. Keep the model tier comparable across products whenever possible.
6. Record and compare consumption within your paid plan to evaluate durability.
